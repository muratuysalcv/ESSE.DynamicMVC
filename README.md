Dynamic MVC, developed with ASP.NET MVC, is an open source software system. This open source platform, which is not widely used, but its basic working structure was very successful. For this reason, I continued my work even though the team withdrew its support.

In my work, I made the system called ESSE support Oracle, MySql, Postgres and Ms-SQL databases. Then, I prepared the Class architecture of each module and ensured that each module was extensible by having a basic structure.

I took a break from my studies because the OpenDev idea offered a more flexible development environment. Currently, the ESSE system is a platform that can be considered as the starting point depending on the targeted work. If the time comes to convert the OpenDev system with MVC, ESSE will begin to be developed again.
